The **"Arduino-Based Multi-Color Temperature Indicator"** uses an Arduino Uno and TMP36 sensor to measure temperature and control three LEDs (green, yellow, red) as visual indicators. It categorizes temperatures into cold, moderate, and hot, lighting up the corresponding LED. Ideal for beginners, it demonstrates sensor integration with Arduino.
